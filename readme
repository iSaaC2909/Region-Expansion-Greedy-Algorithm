# Region Expansion Greedy Algorithm

## Overview

The **Region Expansion Greedy Algorithm** is a novel greedy approach for solving optimization problems where you need to select a subset of items based on maximizing the total benefit while minimizing the total cost. This algorithm builds a region of selected tasks progressively, adding tasks in such a way that the most beneficial tasks (in terms of benefit-to-cost ratio) are selected first, while ensuring that the overall cost does not exceed a specified budget.

The algorithm is particularly effective when the task or item selection is subject to resource constraints, such as limited budget, time, or capacity.

## Features

- **Greedy Task Selection**: The algorithm selects tasks/items based on their benefit-to-cost ratio in descending order.
- **Resource-Constrained**: The selection continues until the total cost exceeds a predefined budget.
- **Progressive Expansion**: It starts with no selected tasks and progressively expands the selected set by greedily choosing the best task/item at each step.
- **Optimized for Budgeting Problems**: This algorithm is designed to handle optimization problems where the goal is to maximize benefits while staying within a resource limit.

## Problem Scenario

The algorithm is ideal for scenarios where you have a set of tasks (or items), each with a cost and a benefit. You want to select tasks that maximize the total benefit while ensuring that the total cost remains below a specified budget.

### Example Problem: Task Selection with Budget Constraint

Given a set of tasks, each with a cost and a benefit, select the tasks that maximize the total benefit while ensuring that the total cost does not exceed the available budget.

### Pseudocode Description

1. **Initialize**: Start with an empty set of selected tasks.
2. **Sort**: Sort tasks based on their benefit-to-cost ratio in descending order.
3. **Select Tasks**: Greedily select tasks one by one. Add a task to the selected set if it doesn't exceed the budget.
4. **Terminate**: Stop when no more tasks can be added without exceeding the budget.
5. **Output**: Return the total benefit of the selected tasks.

## How to Use

### Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Task {
    int cost;
    int benefit;
    float benefitCostRatio;  // Benefit-to-cost ratio for greedy selection

    Task(int c, int b) : cost(c), benefit(b) {
        benefitCostRatio = static_cast<float>(b) / c;  // Calculate benefit-to-cost ratio
    }
};

bool compareTasks(const Task& a, const Task& b) {
    return a.benefitCostRatio > b.benefitCostRatio;  // Sort by benefit-to-cost ratio
}

int regionExpansionGreedy(vector<Task>& tasks, int budget) {
    // Sort tasks based on benefit-to-cost ratio in descending order
    sort(tasks.begin(), tasks.end(), compareTasks);

    int totalBenefit = 0;
    int totalCost = 0;

    // Initialize region (empty set of tasks)
    vector<Task> selectedTasks;

    for (const auto& task : tasks) {
        // If adding this task exceeds the budget, stop
        if (totalCost + task.cost > budget) {
            break;
        }

        // Add the task to the region
        selectedTasks.push_back(task);
        totalCost += task.cost;
        totalBenefit += task.benefit;
    }

    // Output the selected tasks
    cout << "Selected tasks: \n";
    for (const auto& task : selectedTasks) {
        cout << "Cost: " << task.cost << ", Benefit: " << task.benefit << endl;
    }

    // Return the total benefit of the selected tasks
    return totalBenefit;
}

int main() {
    // Define the tasks with cost and benefit
    vector<Task> tasks = {
        Task(3, 6),
        Task(2, 4),
        Task(5, 8),
        Task(6, 7),
        Task(4, 5)
    };

    // Define the budget
    int budget = 10;

    // Call the region expansion greedy algorithm and get the maximum total benefit
    int maxBenefit = regionExpansionGreedy(tasks, budget);

    // Output the maximum benefit achieved within the budget
    cout << "Maximum total benefit within budget: " << maxBenefit << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Functions:

- **`Task`**: Represents each task with its `cost`, `benefit`, and computed `benefit-to-cost` ratio.
- **`compareTasks`**: Custom comparison function to sort tasks by their `benefit-to-cost` ratio in descending order.
- **`regionExpansionGreedy`**: The core algorithm that greedily selects tasks based on the sorted order and the budget constraint.

### Parameters:

- **`tasks`**: A vector of `Task` objects, each containing the `cost` and `benefit` of a task.
- **`budget`**: The total available budget or resource limit that the selected tasks' cost should not exceed.

### Output:

- The function returns the total benefit of the selected tasks that fit within the budget, and it also prints out the selected tasks.

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting** the tasks takes **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of tasks.
- The greedy selection loop takes **O(n)**, iterating over all tasks.
- **Total time complexity**: **O(n log n)** due to sorting.

## Space Complexity

- **Space complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of tasks, as we store the tasks and the selected tasks.

## Use Cases

- **Budget-Constrained Selection**: Ideal for scenarios where you have a fixed budget or limited resources, and you need to maximize benefits or output.
- **Task Scheduling**: Useful for scheduling tasks with different costs and benefits, where you want to optimize the total output without exceeding the available time or cost.
- **Resource Allocation**: Apply this approach to allocate resources in a way that maximizes the return or benefit from those resources.
- **Subset Selection Problems**: Use this algorithm when you need to select the most valuable subset of items from a larger set, subject to a budget or resource constraint.
